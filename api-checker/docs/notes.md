The nested hierarchical structure of a degree programme is modelled using an AND-OR Tree. Each threshold node defines a predicate that evaluates to a boolean value. An AND Node is used to model a set of requirements that must all be fulfilled for the node to evaluate to TRUE. An OR Node evaluates to TRUE when any of its child nodes evaluates to TRUE and the threshold value defined on the node is satisfied. Individual courses are represented as leaf nodes and are atomic.
